			<h1 class="page-header">About Algos</h1>
			<p>Algos is currently in beta testing. There will be quite a few changes as time goes on and I ask that all visitors contribute whatever knowledge they have, as it will help Algos become "the SparkNotes for Computer Scientists."</p>
			<p>Algos is a crowd-sourced approach to gathering both algorithm information (in a manner similar to Wikipedia) and code in various languages for these algorithms. There is no user hierarchy and anybody with a Google account may access and edit any of the information. Their changes will also be tracked and reported to the community. Code, submitted by language and algorithm, is voted on by all users. The amount of 'likes' a user gets determines his/her own reputation on the site. Reputation depends not only on points but awards. Awards are given on certain milestones and are listed alongside these milestones toward the bottom of this page.</p>
			<p>The goal of Algos is to serve as the de facto reference for all algorithm information and implementation. Consolidating the language-specific implementations of algorithms in one place, where it is subject to criticism of other developers, means bugs/errors in code are more easily noticed and reported to the author. This consolidation/fact-checking means developers seeking code will have faith in others' code. Beyond that, Algos may serve as a place for developers to learn languages by way of example.</p>

			<h1 class="page-header">Guidelines</h1>
			<h4>Submitting an algorithm</h4>
			<p>Algorithms, once submitted, may <em>not</em> be changed. For this reason, the submission of a new algorithm should not be taken lightly. Duplicated algorithms leads to a clutter of the database and an annoyance for other users searching a specific bit of code for the algorithm. As such, I would like to ask every contributor to follow the following steps before submitting a new algorithm</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Search the database to see if the algorithm exists.</li>
				<li>If it is not found, think of keywords which could help find it, and search for those. You may instead improve an existing algo.</li>
				<li>If positive that the algo doesn't already exist, you may submit it!</li>
				<li>Write a short description (this will be limited to 200 characters) that briefly details the <em>most</em> important goals of the algo</li>
				<li>Think of at least three keywords which properly describe the algorithm. Currently, stems are not considered in searching, so consider both 'line' and 'lines,' for example.</li>
				<li>The name should be specific. Instead of 'find-GCD,' for Euclid's Algorithm, we would enter 'Euclid's'</li>
			</ol>
			<br/>
			<h4>Submitting a language</h4>
			<p>The same guidelines for algorithms apply here. There is a page dedicated to languages, so a simple search in the browser should find whichever language you want.</p>
			<p><em>When submitting languages with '++' in their name or other symbols, please spell out the symbol or use the first letter. 'C++' is found under 'Cpp.'</em></p>
			<br/>
			<h1 class="page-header">Error Reporting and Version</h1>
			<p>Algos is currently in an open beta. As such, the developer console in most browsers may--from time to time--show an error. If this ever happens, please send a copy of the error text to theelee13@gmail.com. Algos is also open source, its code can be found on GitHub under <a href="http://www.github.com/theelee13/Algos">my profile</a>. Algos is an open source encyclopedia of code and its success is dependent entirely on user volume and activity. Algos has a GNU license.</p>

			<h1 class="page-header">About Edward</h1>
			<p>I am an intern at CyCore Systems in Decatur, Georgia. I work under Sean McCord and Laurel Lawson, who have been generous enough to allow me the time to develop Algos. Algos is not the work of CyCore, but it is thanks to CyCore that I was able to create it. I study CS, Math, and Philosophy at Georgia State University and am a member of the Honors College.</p>
			<h1 class="page-header">Donations</h1>
			<p>As previously mentioned, I am an intern and am supporting Algos on my own. I will never incorporate ads onto the site and so I'm dependent on donations to keep Algos running. As such, I'm currently working with BitPay to set up an account for donations. Until I have the API up and running, you may donate bitcoin to 1CDz5pSAPJCmgx5j7be1BKg3BSrvkfbdEf. Thank you very much, every .000001 is appreciated! :)</p>
			<p>On donation, please send me (theelee13@gmail.com) proof of donation and your first/last name as displayed on Algos, and you will be rewarded with a "Supporter" badge on the site. Varying transaction sizes will also be noted in the badge title.</p>
